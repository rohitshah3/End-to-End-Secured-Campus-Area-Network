# End-to-End-Secured-Campus-Area-Network
The main goal of this project is to make secured campus network design to protect against common internal attacks such as ARP Spoofing, DHCP Snooping, VLAN Hopping, and DOS attacks. As Network security is a growing concern in todayâ€™s digital phenomenon it is imperative to have an system in place to protect the data and system from common attacks, approve or block unauthorized access and monitor traffic using network monitoring tool

### Tools used:
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- GNS3
- PRTG


### Usage: 
- InterVLAN Communication is possible between different department's Dept. Head, Professors, Students and Lab
- Network-Admin can remotely access using SSH
- As access-lists is created only permitted traffic is allowed to send traffic to data-center
- ARP Spoofing, DHCP Snooping, DHCP Starvation Attack, VLan Hopping attack is prevented in our network
- Monitor network performance parameters using PRTG


### Conclusion:
- We created design of Campus Area Network using Cisco Packet Tracer
- We learned and implemented VLANS for segregation of (Dept Head, Professors, Students Labs), InterVlan Routing (Router on Stick Method) for interVlan communication     between different departments, OSPF Routing Protocol for finding best routing path, Access Control Lists to permit and deny traffic
- We learned about different servers such as ( HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DHCP) and added these multiple services in one server
- We done data center survey to know about existing college network for comparative analysis with our design of campus network
- We learned and prevented common attacks that are possible in campus network such as (ARP Spoofing, DHCP Snooping, DHCP Starvation Attack, VLAN Hopping)
- We measured network performance parameters by integrating GNS3 with PRTG


### Future Work:
- Implementing Firewall to prevent external security attacks
- In depth working on network performance parameters
- Managing network traffic to enhance network performance in our project
- Also we can create intrusion detection system to protect the campus network
